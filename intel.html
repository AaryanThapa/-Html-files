    <p>In the manifesto, the party has promised it would build foundations for good governance, prosperity and socialism in each of the local units that it gets a chance to lead for the next five years. Likewise, it says the local officials elected from the party will work as servants but not as rulers.

        The manifesto was launched amid a grand function organised at the party’s new office building in Chyasal of Kathmandu.
        
        The UML has said it would prioritise improvements in education at government schools, expansion of technical education, quality health services, drinking water facilities, advancements in agriculture, new physical infrastructures and integrated settlements among others.
        
        In addition to renewed old promises, the manifesto also discusses at length the achievements of the party’s leadership of the federal governments and its views about other political forces in the country.</p>
